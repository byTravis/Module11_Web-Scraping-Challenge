## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

### Instructions:

Use automated browsing to visit the [Mars Temperature Data Site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html).  Extract the weather data from the table on the website and add it to a Pandas DataFrame with the appropiate data type for each column.  Then, answer the following questions:

- **How many months exist on Mars?**

- **How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?**

- **What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:**

  - **Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.**

  - **Plot the results as a bar chart.**

- **Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:**

  - **Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.**

  - **Plot the results as a bar chart.**

- **About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:**

  - **Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.**

  - **Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.**

Once complete, export the website data to a CSV file.
